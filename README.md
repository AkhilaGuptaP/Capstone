# Airbnb Booking analysis

**Project Summary**



*   The "Airbnb Bookings Analysis EDA Project" is a comprehensive data
analysis project that explores a dataset containing detailed information on Airbnb listings in New York City for the year 2019. The project objective is to unveil valuable insights for both hosts and guests within the Airbnb ecosystem in the heart of New York's vibrant marketplace.


*   The project's primary task is to identify and handle null values and do the necessary data cleaning to ensure the integrity of the data.


*   The project's first objective is to conduct a thorough examination of pricing, as it is the most important factor for both hosts and guests. We aim to determine the average price of Airbnb listings and also analyze how different neighborhood groups and room types are priced. This information is useful for travelers seeking accommodations that align with their budgets and for hosts aiming to competitively price their offerings.


*   Identifying and managing outliers is an important aspect of the project and employs robust statistical techniques to detect and address outliers effectively, ensuring the integrity of the findings.


*   The project also assesses the proportion of each room type within the dataset, providing potential guests with a clear understanding of the variety of accommodation options available, from shared rooms to cozy private rooms to spacious entire apartments.


*   It also aims to understand the distribution of room types across the diverse neighborhoods of the city, along with price variation. This uncovers which types of accommodations are more prevalent in specific areas and helps us understand their pricing range. This knowledge empowers hosts to cater to local demand and allows guests to find accommodations that suit their preferences.


*   Guest reviews and ratings play an important role in Airbnb's user experience. The project analyzes these reviews to identify and showcase the most popular neighborhoods in New York City. This knowledge enables travelers to make well-informed decisions while selecting neighborhoods with a history of positive guest experiences.


*   Furthermore, the project explores the availability of Airbnb listings throughout the year (Availability_365) across different neighborhood groups and room types. This analysis offers valuable insights into when and where accommodations are accessible, helping travelers plan their trips.


*   The project identifies and ranks the top neighborhoods based on the number of Airbnb listings or properties. This information is valuable for hosts looking to strategically manage their listings and for guests selecting popular areas to stay.
Also explores number of hosts per location and understanding most active hosts, top hosts per each room type will be useful information to enhance the business.


*   Furthermore, analysing the average minimum nights stay required across different room type and how it is effecting the booking.

    
*   Finally, the project employs latitude and longitude mapping to visually represent the locations of Airbnb listings across New York City. This spatial insight offers a deeper understanding of the distribution of listings within the city. Adding the availability factor makes it much more useful.

*   By addressing various questions and objectives, this analysis provides valuable insights to Airbnb hosts and guests, guiding pricing strategies, listing management, neighborhood selection, and overall trip planning. The application of exploratory data analysis, statistical techniques, and data visualization brings forth fascinating patterns and trends within the dataset, making it an indispensable resource for anyone engaging with Airbnb in New York City.
